Bits and pieces for LaTeX
=========================
This package provides a list of randomly assorted bits and pieces that I found useful for
writting physics papers.

Among others it contains:

  * A small collection of special characters and symbol definitions, such as
  `\degC` for degree celsius, `\un` for units in upright mode, an `\underwiggle`
  command, etc...
  * A `\com` command to create side-margin comments in different colors for each
  user
  * Various commands to setup figures in common layout, e.g. such that all figures
  in a row are scaled to have the same height.

For the full description, refer to the guide.
